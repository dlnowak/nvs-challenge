# New Variorum Shakespeare Digital Challenge

The MLA Committee on the New Variorum Edition of Shakespeare is sponsoring a [digital challenge](http://www.mla.org/nvs_challenge) and is seeking the most innovative and compelling uses of the data contained within its recently released volume, _The Comedy of Errors_.

The MLA has released the XML files and schema for _The Comedy of Errors_ under a [Creative Commons BY-NC 3.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/). Scholars may freely download these files from GitHub and use this material in their research.

We are seeking innovative new means of displaying, representing, and exploring this data, and are thus holding a competition to find the most exciting API, interface, visualization, data-mining project, or other use of _The Comedy of Errors_ XML.

Entries will be judged by the committee, working with the office of scholarly communication. The winner will receive $500 and will be recognized at the 2013 MLA convention in Boston. Other entries may be displayed at the convention as well.

URLs for all entries must be submitted by e-mail to <nvs@mla.org> and must be received no later than Friday, 31 August 2012, at 11:59 p.m. eastern daylight time.
